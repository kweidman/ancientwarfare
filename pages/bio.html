		<p>Based in Lexington, KY, Ancient Warfare are currently promoting their Spring 2015 debut release with Alias Records, <i>The Pale Horse</i>. Initially intended as a 4-song EP, <i>The Pale Horse</i> evolved into a full-length album over the course of several years during which the band experienced intense personal and musical evolution.<br><br>

		In 2010, lead singer/guitarist Echo Wilcox approached Duane Lundy of Shangri-La Productions with a compilation of loosely established songs. At the time a student of photography and motion graphics at the Savannah College of Art and Design, Wilcox's composition process was heavily informed by translating traditional visuals into conceptual soundscapes. Lundy, a long-time friend and collaborator, remained producer/engineer of the project as Wilcox fleshed out her original pieces into a wholly realized album. Over the following four years, the studio became home and haven to the various permutations of Ancient Warfare.<br><br>

		Originally a 2-piece consisting of Wilcox on guitar and fellow SCAD student Azniv Korkejian on drums, the current line-up of violinist Rachel Yanarella (Oh My Me), classically trained multi-instrumentalist Emily Hagihara (Chico Fellini, Jim James and solo work), and recently recruited bassist Derrick Rhineheimer (Oh My Me) is a reflection of the collaborative nature of <i>The Pale Horse</i> and the Lexington music community as a whole. Ensconced in a place of dynamic artistry, Wilcox and her band-mates were able to develop the distinctly cinematic, genre-bending sound of their debut album. <br><br>

		"The apocalypse seems the most appropriate subject," said Wilcox. "Not in an epic sense, but in a sense that it is all-encompassing." Indeed, <i>The Pale Horse</i> lures the listener into a golden dreamscape only to darkly demand resolution to the inescapable, universal plagues of love and death. This apocalyptic thread running throughout reminds us that everything good and true can end; The wild beauty of a crashing wave will inevitably become the succumbing regress of the tide. Such polarizing themes are pervasive throughout the record; expansive skies versus one small soul, wretched mourning versus hopeful newness, our eternal quest for answers versus a relieved embrace of cyclical, unavoidable truths. Wilcox's yearning vocals fluctuate in kind, emitted sometimes as a howl as on "Dreamcatcher Bull," sometimes as a macabre rollick as on "Gunsmoke." The resulting sound is of a southwestern gothic breed, evoking images of tribal eccentricity and dramatic decay.<br><br>

		Over the course of recording <i>The Pale Horse</i>, Ancient Warfare developed a fierce reputation for hard work and aggressive performance, sharing stages with artists such as Raveonettes, Richard Buckner, The War on Drugs, Chelsea Wolfe, Scout Niblett, Mr. Gnome and Lucius.</p>
